        string "Cross compiler prefix"
    default "arm-none-eabi-" if ARCH_ARM
    default "i686-pc-linux-gnu-" if ARCH_I386
    default ""
        help
            Set the cross compiler prefix, like arm-linux-gnueabi-
            Ensure the compiler is in your PATH or include the full
            path of the compiler in the prefix, such as
            /opt/toolchains/gcc4/arm-linux-gnueabi-

    config KERNEL_COMPILER
        string "Path to a different compiler to use for the kernel"
    default ""
        help
            If you set this option to a non-empty string, this compiler will be
            used for compiling the kernel. The compiler specified by your
            cross-compiler prefix will still be used for user-space. Note that
            this option does not affect the pre-processor, assembler or linker
            used on the kernel.

    config KERNEL_CFLAGS
        string "Compiler flags to use for compiling the kernel"
    default ""
        help
            Setting this option to a non-empty string overrides the default
            flags (and those you have selected elsewhere in the build
            configuration) that are passed to the compiler when compiling the
            kernel. This does not affect the compiler flags passed when
            compiling user-space.

            Use this option with care as it will prevent several sane default
            options that are normally passed. Note that this does not prevent
            DEFINES being passed to the compiler. This causes the pre-processor
            invocations in the kernel to assume they are targetting a non-GNU
            compiler. It does not affect the assembling or linking of the
            kernel.

    config KERNEL_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS
        string "Extra CPP flags to use for compiling the kernel"
        default ""
        help
            These flags will be appended to the C pre-processor flags used when
            compiling the kernel. Note these will not be applied during
            user-space pre-processing.

    config USER_DEBUG_INFO
        bool "Emit debugging information"
        default n
        help
            Emit debugging information when compiling applications and
            libraries. This does not affect the compiler flags applied to the
            kernel.

    config USER_EXTRA_CFLAGS
        string "Extra userspace CFLAGS"
        default ""
        depends on USER_CFLAGS = ""
        help
            Extra flags to append when compiling applications and libraries.
            This does not affect the flags applied when compiling the kernel.

    config USER_CFLAGS
        string "Override userspace CFLAGS"
        default ""
        help
            A set of flags to be used as the ONLY options when compiling
            applications and libraries. This does not affect the flags applied
            when compiling the kernel. This option takes precedence over "Extra
            userspace CFLAGS" and should be used with care.

    config BUILDSYS_USE_CCACHE
        bool "Use ccache to improve build performance"
        default y
        help
            ccache will cache object files based on compiler name, compile flags
            and source file name. On the next attempt to compile this file with
            the same compiler and flags, the object file will be copied from the
            cache rather than compiling from source.

        default n
        depends on USER_CFLAGS = ""
        help
            Link time optimisations allow optimisations to be performed at link time
            enabling cross file optimisations to happen. Support for this may not exist
            in your compiler, and even if there is your build may explode.
            Consider this feature experimental!

    config WHOLE_PROGRAM_OPTIMISATIONS_USER
        bool "Link user assuming whole program"
        default n
        help
            Enable -fwhole-program when performing link step. This may be buggy if your build
            involves linking at times when -fwhole-program would not be correct to give. This
            will cause -fwhole-program to be passed when linking user elf images
            Consider this feature experimental!

    config WHOLE_PROGRAM_OPTIMISATIONS_KERNEL
        bool "Link kernel assuming whole program"
        default n
        help
            Enable -fwhole-program when linking kernel. This should work modulo gcc bugs, which
            are not uncommon with -fwhole-program
            Consider this feature experimental!

    config USER_DEBUG_BUILD
        bool "build user level with assertions, -g and debugging messages"
        default y if DEBUG_BUILD
        help
            Build user level as a debugging environment. If this option is off,
            NDEBUG is passed to Musl C which will turn off assertions. This will
            enable -g for user level.

    config BUILDSYS_CPP_SEPARATE
        bool "Separately invoke CPP"
        default n
        help
            Invoke the pre-processor in a separate step and produce an
            intermediate .c_pp file. This is relevant if you are wanting to
            verify C code or debug the pre-processor output.

    config BUILDSYS_CPP_RETAIN_COMMENTS
        bool "CPP: retain comments"
        default y
        depends on BUILDSYS_CPP_SEPARATE
        help
            Retain comments after pre-processing C code. This can be useful
            when the comments contain directives to the verification C parser.

    config BUILDSYS_CPP_LINE_DIRECTIVES
        bool "CPP: Emit line directives"
        default y
        depends on BUILDSYS_CPP_SEPARATE
        help
            Emit line directives in pre-processed C code. This allows your
            compiler to give you error messages indicating the source
            locations in original files. You might wish to switch this off if
            your pre-processed C file is then being used as an input to another
            process for which original source locations are no longer
            meaningful, or when your final compiler does not understand line
            directives.
